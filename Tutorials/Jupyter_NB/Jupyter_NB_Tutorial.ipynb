    "* The Jupyter Notebook contains two components: \n",
    "    * A web application: a browser-based tool for interactive authoring of documents which combine explanatory text,             mathematics, computations and their rich media output.\n",
    "    * Notebook documents: a representation of all content visible in the web application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects.\n",

    "## Opening Notebooks\n",
    "* An open notebook has exactly one interactive session connected to a kernel, which will execute code sent by the user and communicate back results. This kernel remains active if the web browser window is closed, and reopening the same notebook from the dashboard will reconnect the web application to the same kernel. In the dashboard, notebooks with an active kernel have a Shutdown button next to them, whereas notebooks without an active kernel have a Delete button in its place.\n",
    "* Other clients may connect to the same kernel. When each kernel is started, the notebook server prints to the terminal a message like this: [NotebookApp] Kernel started: 87f7d2c0-13e3-43df-8bb8-1bd37aaf3373 This long string is the kernel’s ID which is sufficient for getting the information necessary to connect to the kernel."

    "## Structure of a Notebook Document\n",
    "* The notebook consists of a sequence of cells. A cell is a multiline text input field, and its contents can be executed by using Shift-Enter, or by clicking either the “Play” button the toolbar, or Cell, Run in the menu bar. The execution behavior of a cell is determined by the cell’s type. There are three types of cells: code cells, markdown cells, and raw cells. Every cell starts off being a code cell, but its type can be changed by using a drop-down on the toolbar (which will be “Code”, initially), or via keyboard shortcuts.\n",

    "###  Code Cells\n",
    "* A code cell allows you to edit and write new code, with full syntax highlighting and tab completion. The programming language you use depends on the kernel, and the default kernel (IPython) runs Python code. \n",
    "* When a code cell is executed, code that it contains is sent to the kernel associated with the notebook. The results that are returned from this computation are then displayed in the notebook as the cell’s output. The output is not limited to text, with many other possible forms of output are also possible, including matplotlib figures and HTML tables (as used, for example, in the pandas data analysis package). This is known as IPython’s rich display capability.\n",

    "### Markdown Cells\n",
    "* You can document the computational process in a literate way, alternating descriptive text with code, using rich text. In IPython this is accomplished by marking up text with the Markdown language. The corresponding cells are called Markdown cells. The Markdown language provides a simple way to perform this text markup, that is, to specify which parts of the text should be emphasized (italics), bold, form lists, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you want to provide structure for your document, you can use markdown headings. Markdown headings consist of 1 to 6 hash # signs # followed by a space and the title of your section. The markdown heading will be converted to a clickable link for a section of the notebook. It is also used as a hint when exporting to other document formats, like PDF.\n",
    "* When a Markdown cell is executed, the Markdown code is converted into the corresponding formatted rich text. Markdown allows arbitrary HTML code for formatting.\n",
    "* Within Markdown cells, you can also include mathematics in a straightforward way, using standard LaTeX notation:\\\\$...\\\\$ for inline mathematics and \\\\$$...\\\\$$ for displayed mathematics. \n",
    "* When the Markdown cell is executed, the LaTeX portions areautomatically rendered in the HTML output as equations with high quality typography. This is made possible by MathJax, which supports a large subset of LaTeX functionality\n",
    "* Standard mathematics environments defined by LaTeX and AMS-LaTeX (the amsmath package) also work, such as begin{equation}...end{equation}, and begin{align}...end{align}. New LaTeX macros may be defined using standard methods, such as \\newcommand, by placing them anywhere between math delimiters in a Markdown cell. These definitions are then available throughout the rest of the IPython session.\n",

When passed through nbconvert, raw cells arrive in the destination format unmodified. For example, you can type full LaTeX into a raw cell, which will only be rendered by LaTeX after conversion by nbconvert."
