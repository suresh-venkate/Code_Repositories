    "* Compared to other languages like C/C++, Python is slower. But an important feature of Python is that it can be easily extended with C/C++. This feature helps us to write computationally intensive codes in C/C++ and create a Python wrapper for it so that we can use these wrappers as Python modules. This gives us two advantages: \n",
    "    * first, our code is as fast as original C/C++ code (since it is the actual C++ code working in background) and\n",
    "    * second, it is very easy to code in Python. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* This is how OpenCV-Python works, it is a Python wrapper around original C++ implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Also, the support of Numpy makes the task more easier. Numpy is a highly optimized library for numerical operations. It gives a MATLAB-style syntax. All the OpenCV array structures are converted to-and-from Numpy arrays. So whatever operations we can do in Numpy, we can combine it with OpenCV, which increases number of weapons in our arsenal. Besides that, several other libraries like SciPy, Matplotlib which supports Numpy can also be used with this.\n",
